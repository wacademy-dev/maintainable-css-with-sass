<h3>Lesson 2, Exercise</h3>
<p>We have a&nbsp;<code>.btn</code>&nbsp;class to style our buttons, which features a mint-green background color. As an alternative, we decide to make a class that will turn our button&rsquo;s background pink, via the hex value&nbsp;<code>#EA526F</code>. But it doesn&rsquo;t work! We&rsquo;ve added it to our second button, but it&rsquo;s still mint-green&hellip;</p>
<p>That means that the original .btn class must have a higher specificity than .btn-pink, right? We need to refactor our CSS so that we can override&nbsp;<code>.btn</code>&rsquo;s background color when we apply&nbsp;<code>.btn-pink</code>.</p>
<p>The .scss file is located in /sass/main.scss. It will compile to /public/css/style.css.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate the specificities of the button selectors in the CSS file.</li>
<li>Refactor the CSS so that&nbsp;<code>.btn-pink</code>&nbsp;overrides .btn&rsquo;s background color and turns the second button pink.</li>
<li>This can be done by increasing the specificity of&nbsp;<code>.btn-pink</code>, but in the in interest of maintaining a minimal specificity throughout our code base, we would best be served reducing the specificity of&nbsp;<code>.btn</code></li>
</ul>
