<h3>Lesson 3, Exercise</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ve created poll, where we can vote whether a puppy is adorable, or just flat-out awwwwwww. But now that we&rsquo;ve learned all about the awesomeness of BEM, our CSS feels a bit messy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back and refactor our code by converting the classes that make up our &ldquo;poll&rdquo; block, using the BEM methodology.</p>
<p>The .scss file is located in /sass/main.scss. It will compile to /public/css/style.css.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the block class and use it as the base in the naming for the elements/modifier</li>
<li>Convert the name of the other classes to fit as elements and modifiers within the block poll block.</li>
<li>Update the HTML document with the new class names.</li>
</ul>
