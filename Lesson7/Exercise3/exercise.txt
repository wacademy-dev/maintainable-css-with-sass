<h3>Lesson 7, Exercise 3</h3>
<p>We have a standard button, which is styled by the&nbsp;<code>.btn</code>&nbsp;class, which features a mint-green&nbsp;<code>background-color</code>. We also have a modified button, with a transparent background and mint-green border and font color, created through the&nbsp;<code>.btn--outline</code>&nbsp;modifier.</p>
<p>Now we want to make a color variant on those buttons, where&nbsp;<code>.btn--pink</code>&nbsp;sets the background of&nbsp;<code>.btn</code>&nbsp;to a pink color. And when we use also want to make an alternative to&nbsp;<code>.btn--outline</code>&nbsp;where the the border and font color are pink, rather than the stock mint-green. But we don&rsquo;t want to create an entirely separate modifier that creates both the outline aesthetic of the button, as well as the pink hue.</p>
<p>Instead we want to add&nbsp;<code>.btn--pink</code>&nbsp;to an element that already has a class of&nbsp;<code>.btn--outline</code>, and have it be both outlined AND pink.</p>
<p>The .scss file is located in /sass/main.scss. It will compile to /public/css/style.css.</p>
