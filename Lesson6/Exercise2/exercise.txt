<h3>Lesson 6, Exercise 2</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to get all familial and whatnot as we create selectors that style based on their relationship to the root selector. The code base already contains a selector for the &ldquo;root&rdquo; class. Let&rsquo;s use nesting and combinators to style the elements surrounding and within the .root element in the HTML file.</p>
<p>The .scss file is located in /sass/main.scss. It will compile to /public/css/style.css.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nest a selector for the .general class using the general sibling combinator ( ~ ) and assign it a background-color of your choosing</li>
<li>Nest a selector for the .adjacent class using the adjacent sibling combinator ( + ) and assign it a background color of your choosing</li>
<li>Nest a selector for the .child class using the child combinator ( &gt; ) and assign it a background-color of your choosing.</li>
<li>Nest a selector for the .descendant class using the descendant.</li>
<li>Normally the descendant combinator is a space &ldquo; &rdquo;, but with Sass, directly nesting a selector will compile as the space of the descendant combinator in the CSS.</li>
<li>Assign the nested .descendant selector a background-color of your choosing.</li>
<li>Review the resulting rendered HTML in the browser pane by clicking the refresh icon.</li>
<li>Review the compiled CSS, which is located in /public/css/</li>
<li>Each combinator class should be prefixed with the .root class and appropriate combinator symbol</li>
</ul>
