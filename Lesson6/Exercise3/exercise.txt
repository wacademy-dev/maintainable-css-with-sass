<h3>Lesson 6, Exercise 3</h3>
<p>Nesting in Sass is awesome, but sometimes we might want to nest a selector that doesn&rsquo;t work any of the CSS combinators, such as pseudo-selectors like&nbsp;<code>:hover</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>:focus</code>. For times like those, we want to use the ampersand ( &amp; ) to join the name of the parent to child being nested.</p>
<p>The .scss file is located in /sass/main.scss. It will compile to /public/css/style.css.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nest a&nbsp;<code>:focus</code>&nbsp;selector within the&nbsp;<code>.input</code>&nbsp;class selector</li>
<li>Add a new background color and font color to the the&nbsp;<code>:focus</code>&nbsp;selector</li>
<li>Check out the result by interacting with the text box in the browser pane</li>
<li>Review the resulting CSS. The focus state should be styled with a selector that compiled as&nbsp;<code>.input:focus {...}</code></li>
</ul>
