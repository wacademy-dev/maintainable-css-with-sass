<h3>Lesson 6, Exercise 4</h3>
<p>Nesting in Sass is awesome, but sometimes we might want to nest a selector that doesn&rsquo;t work any of the CSS combinators, such as pseudo-selectors like&nbsp;<code>:hover</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>:focus</code>. For times like those, we want to use the ampersand ( &amp; ) to join the name of the parent to child being nested.</p>
<p>The .scss file is located in /sass/main.scss. It will compile to /public/css/style.css.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Move the nested&nbsp;<code>.particle</code>&nbsp;selector up one level in the hierarchy, putting it on the same level as the&nbsp;<code>.atom</code>&nbsp;selector.</li>
<li>The rendered HTML should now look a bit different, with another&nbsp;<code>.particle</code>&nbsp;div showing up that wasn&rsquo;t styled by the previously over-specific&nbsp;<code>.particle</code>&nbsp;selector.</li>
<li>Move the nested&nbsp;<code>.particle</code>&nbsp;selector up one level in the hierarchy, putting it on the same level as the&nbsp;<code>.atom</code>&nbsp;selector.</li>
</ul>
