<h3>Lesson 10, Exercise 2</h3>
<p>Extending our heading elements to&nbsp;<code>.heading-typography</code>&nbsp;is working just fine, but it does result in a class selector that doesn&rsquo;t actually get used by any of the blocks or elements on our site. Instead,&nbsp;<code>.heading-typography</code>&nbsp;simply exists for&nbsp;<code>.form__heading</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>.proj-prev__heading</code>&nbsp;to extend to.</p>
<p>Having an unused selector in our CSS could be confusing to future-us, as we might not remember that we are using it to extend other elements to. So, rather than compile useless selectors, let&rsquo;s change&nbsp;<code>.heading-typography</code>&nbsp;from a class selector to a&nbsp;<strong>placeholder</strong>.</p>
<p>The .scss file is located in /sass/main.scss. It will compile to /public/css/style.css.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Convert&nbsp;<code>.heading-typography</code>&nbsp;from a class selector to a placeholder by swapping the prefixing &ldquo;.&rdquo; to a percent sign (%)</li>
<li>Update&nbsp;<code>.form__heading</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>.proj-prev__heading</code>&nbsp;so that they extend to the new&nbsp;<code>%heading-typography</code>&nbsp;placeholder, rather than the&nbsp;<code>.heading-typography</code>&nbsp;selector that no longer exists</li>
<li>Review the rendered HTML to ensure that nothing has visually changed about the page</li>
<li>Review the compiled CSS. The heading-typography rule set should still have&nbsp;<code>.form__heading</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>.proj-prev__heading</code>&nbsp;attached to it, but there shouldn&rsquo;t be any instances of the&nbsp;<code>%heading-typography</code>&nbsp;selector</li>
</ul>
