<h3>Lesson 10, Exercise 1</h3>
<p>Our website is full of different pages and layouts, such as the&nbsp;<code>.form</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>.proj-prev</code>&nbsp;blocks. Each of those blocks needs a heading element, which should receive the same typographic rules. We could use mixins to take care of this, but that can lead to a bunch of repetitive code in compiled CSS.</p>
<p>Instead, we can create a&nbsp;<code>.heading-typography</code>&nbsp;selector and use it to hold all of the styles we need for our heading elements, and then extend the heading selectors to&nbsp;<code>.heading-typography</code>.</p>
<p>The .scss file is located in /sass/main.scss. It will compile to /public/css/style.css.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a&nbsp;<code>.heading-typography</code>&nbsp;selector and give it some typographic properties, such as&nbsp;<code>font-size</code>,&nbsp;<code>font-style</code>,&nbsp;<code>color</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Use nesting and the ampersand to create heading elements for the&nbsp;<code>.form</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>.proj-prev</code>&nbsp;blocks</li>
<li>Use the&nbsp;<code>@extend</code>&nbsp;keyword to extend the new&nbsp;<code>.form__heading</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>.proj-prev__heading</code>&nbsp;elements to&nbsp;<code>.heading-typography</code></li>
<li>Review the rendered HTML. Both rendered blocks should reflect the typographic properties and values set in&nbsp;<code>.heading-typography</code></li>
<li>Review the compiled CSS. The rule set for&nbsp;<code>.heading-typography</code>&nbsp;should also have selectors for&nbsp;<code>.form__heading</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>.proj-prev__heading</code>, each separated by commas</li>
</ul>
