<h3>Lesson 9, Exercise 1</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re using borders all over our site. They all have the same thickness, a solid line, and, to date, the same color. Rather than having to type all of that out, let&rsquo;s create a&nbsp;<code>@mixin</code>&nbsp;for it. This will save us some typing in the long run, and let us update the look of the border globally by updating the contents of the mixin.</p>
<p>The .scss file is located in /sass/main.scss. It will compile to /public/css/style.css.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a mixin called&nbsp;<code>border</code>&nbsp;using the&nbsp;<code>@mixin</code>&nbsp;keyword</li>
<li>Add a border property to it, with a thickness of&nbsp;<code>.1rem</code>, a solid line, and a color of&nbsp;<code>$color-primary</code>.</li>
<li>Replace instances of the border property in our code base with our new&nbsp;<code>border</code>&nbsp;mixin, using the&nbsp;<code>@include</code>&nbsp;keyword.</li>
<li>Review the rendered HTML ensuring that things still look the same</li>
<li>Review the CSS to see that the Sass replaced instances of the mixin with it&rsquo;s defined contents:&nbsp;<code>border: .1rem solid #15DEA5;</code></li>
</ul>
